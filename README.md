# Task-Board
This is the Day 5 challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
I was motivated to learn how to make a bootstrap and jQuery and how to make a working taskbar.
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to better understand Bootstrap and JQuery. Later, I learned how to read the code and fix it.
What problems does it solve?
It solves the problems of looking at and reading codes and regaining the code so that you can understand it and make it fit the objective of the changes.
What did I learn?
I learned how to make draggable cards and save information in cards every time I used them.
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out because of how they saved all the information, as well as the beautiful borders I made for my work.

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css, and Javascript to use my project.
I used my git bash to commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Task-Board project.
